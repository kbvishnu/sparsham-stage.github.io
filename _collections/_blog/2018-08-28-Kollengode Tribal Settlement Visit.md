Tribals in Kerala (Adivasis of Kerala) are the indigenous population found in the southern Indian state of Kerala. 
Most of the tribal people of Kerala live in the forests and mountains of Western Ghats, bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

Sparsham organized a visit to the tribal settlement and aid them by providing some of the necessities to close to 140 families.
As we all know that there are lot of govt policies which provide a lot of benefits to the tribal people, but only a few will get the benefits.
The people who receives the benefits may have a better life situation while compared to others. People who ever visit any tribal settlement
will understand the life conditions there.

mainly focused on providing education support, we had a chance to visit the tribal settlements of Palakkad and Thrissur earlier. We multiple times
visited and spend some time with them, celebrates Onam etc.
