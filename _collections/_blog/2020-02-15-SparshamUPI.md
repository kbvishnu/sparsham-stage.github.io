Sparsham encourages only digital transactions from its begining. Almost all our financial transactions leverages the online banking capabilities. This requires the donor to add account details to their payee list and based on the banks condition, it may take a day to make a transfer. We are working with our banking service provider for a Unified Payment Interface (UPI) to overcome these kind of tasks which requries more time and patience. 

Now our banking partner provides the UPI handler. Unified Payments Interface ([UPI]) is an instant real-time payment system developed by National Payments Corporation of India facilitating inter-bank transactions. The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and works by instantly transferring funds between two bank accounts on a mobile platform. 

The creation of a UPI handler was one of main action item and Sayuj was working with bank for the official formalities prior to submit the request. 
**Sparsham@SBI** is the UPI handler associated with our account. Members and donars are requested to ensure the UPI handler before initiating a transaction. In India, there are lot of phishing activities identified by creating UPI handlers with slight changes in the text. So make sure you are enaging a transaction with the right handler.
