Sparsham conducted an awarness session and organ donation drive on 6th October 2013 at C Achyuthamenon Hall, near Ernakulam Public Library, Ernakulam.
We organized with association of Kerala Action Force,an organ donation awarness society and they had delivered an unexceptional speech on organ donation - its possibilities, challenges
and the bussiness involved in it. A lot of people were assembled at the hall and lot of questions were discussed. Sparsham gives an organ donor card to those
who willing to donate.

> Live your life, then pass it on !

A high tea was arranged and after the function, we had the Annual General Body Meeting (AGM) and discussed on further activities and elected the steering committee
for the next year.
