We celebrated Onam17 along with residents of Kadappara Tribal Settlement. Our celebration starts with the traditional flower carpet called pookkalam. We saw all of them unanimously joined us to organize our small pookkalam. We had some time interacting with the residents and had a great traditional lunch called Ona Sadya. This is our second visit to Kadappara and we noticed that they requires attention and more helping hands. As conclusion of our day, we gifted Ona kodi , and before we wrap up they made us to offer them promises to visit again with more people. We thank all our members and sponsors to support us. We wish a prosperous and peaceful Onam to all.
